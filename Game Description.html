			<p>
			Our project is to build a 2D Side Scroller game which will include various puzzle/platformer elements, dangerous enemies, and environmental challenges. The game will also have interactions with non-player characters, both as guides and as potential enemies. The last major element will be different levels in the game that the player has to progress through in order to beat the game. The second aspect of our project is to build a website that will allow for a user to be able to access the game.
